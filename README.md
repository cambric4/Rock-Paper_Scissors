    <p> 10/02 - Tried to change code to allow better readability, changing randomChoice under computer function to computer selection. got rid of .toLowerCase at end of human selection prompt.</p>
    <p> 10/03 - tried to remove repetative elements</p>
    <p> 10/10 - completely changed playRound and playGame functions to try and make game work correctly.
              - realized I had been using ' instead of ` for strings and fixed all of that.
              - realized I forgot some ";" and added those on to get game to finally work right!
